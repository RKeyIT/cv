				<p>Hey there!</p>

				<p>
					My name is Raman Krytski, and I'm 27 years old. I really like programming,
					so I went to study it at Minsk College of Business and Law.
					I worked on cool projects and faced challenges during my time there,
					which made me even more interested in programming.
				</p>

				<p>
					But the real turning point was when I started learning web development on my own.
					It was exciting, and I wanted to be really good at it.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the past year, I've been learning a lot about web technologies like
					JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS (ES6/CommonJS), HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Angular,
					React, Redux, Express, MongoDB, Eslint, and Prettier.
					I used some of this cool stuff to create this website you're looking at now.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm thrilled to show you my projects and what I can do with programming.
					If you have any questions or want to work together, feel free to reach out.
					In this time I have a good expirience in TypeScript, React, SASS, NodeJS.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thanks for visiting my website! Take care and enjoy!
				</p>
